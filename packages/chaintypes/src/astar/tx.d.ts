     * designated beneficiary. The spend must be claimed using the `payout` dispatchable within
     * the [`Config::PayoutPeriod`].
     *
     * ### Parameters
     * - `asset_kind`: An indicator of the specific asset class to be spent.
     * - `amount`: The amount to be transferred from the treasury to the `beneficiary`.
     * - `beneficiary`: The beneficiary of the spend.
     * - `valid_from`: The block number from which the spend can be claimed. It can refer to
     * the past if the resulting spend has not yet expired according to the
     * [`Config::PayoutPeriod`]. If `None`, the spend can be claimed immediately after
     * approval.
     *
     * ## Events
     *
     * Emits [`Event::AssetSpendApproved`] if successful.
     *
     * @param {[]} assetKind
     * @param {bigint} amount
