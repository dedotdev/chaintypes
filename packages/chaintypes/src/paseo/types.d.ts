   * XCM to `dest` to mint and deposit reserve-based assets to `beneficiary`. Typically

   * - `TransferType::Teleport`: burn local assets and forward XCM to `dest` chain to

   *
   * - `origin`: Must be capable of withdrawing the `assets` and executing XCM.
   * - `dest`: Destination context for the assets. Will typically be `[Parent,
   * Parachain(..)]` to send from parachain to parachain, or `[Parachain(..)]` to send from
   * relay to parachain, or `(parents: 2, (GlobalConsensus(..), ..))` to send from
   * parachain across a bridge to another ecosystem destination.
   * - `assets`: The assets to be withdrawn. This should include the assets used to pay the
   * fee on the `dest` (and possibly reserve) chains.
   * - `assets_transfer_type`: The XCM `TransferType` used to transfer the `assets`.
   * - `remote_fees_id`: One of the included `assets` to be used to pay fees.
   * - `fees_transfer_type`: The XCM `TransferType` used to transfer the `fees` assets.
   * - `custom_xcm_on_dest`: The XCM to be executed on `dest` chain as the last step of the
   * transfer, which also determines what happens to the assets on the destination chain.
   * - `weight_limit`: The remote-side weight limit, if any, for the XCM fee purchase.
